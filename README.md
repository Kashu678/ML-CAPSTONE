Model Evaluation:

Random Forest performed the best with 90% accuracy and an AUC of 0.91, making it the most suitable model for predicting gender

Challenges:

Handled missing values, slight data imbalance, and feature multicollinearity effectively. Random Forest and XG Boost model proved to be the most robust model.
